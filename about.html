			My name is Emma and I am currently a student at Appalachian State University. I am studying to get my degree in Commercial Photography. I have worked as an assistant wedding photographer for three years and plan to become a product photographer. I also enjoy digital painting and take commissions when I am able. I have worked as a web designer for marketing websites.
